# My Node.js Application

This Node.js application provides a RESTful API for managing users. It includes endpoints to get a list of users, get a specific user by ID, add a new user, and update an existing user. The application is designed with proper error handling to ensure robust and user-friendly interactions.

## Key Features

- **Get All Users:** Retrieve a list of all users in the database.
- **Get User by ID:** Fetch detailed information about a specific user using their unique ID.
- **Add a New User:** Create a new user by sending user details in the request body.
- **Update User Information:** Update existing user information based on their unique ID.

The application is built using Express.js and Mongoose for streamlined server-side operations and MongoDB database interactions. It is designed to be easily deployed and managed on platforms like Render.
